# Address-Detector

Checks if your address exists in Roblox Process (it's kinda shit so please improve it)!

# How to use this?

Open the vcxproj file, go to dllmain.cpp,
Replace 'ADDRESS' with any address of your,
choice, don't rebase as Roblox doesn't really,
do auto rebasing. Voila, your results will show!

**Use Hexidecimal format for best results. Don't use any other format unless you know how to decode it or something.**
